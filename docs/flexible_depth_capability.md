# Flexible Depth: The Core Power of Loglog Format


## Philosophy of Mind-First Structure


- Start writing wherever your thoughts naturally flow
- No need to pre-plan hierarchical structure
- Let the content dictate the organization, not the format
- Reduce cognitive overhead during idea capture
## Organic Growth Pattern


- Natural Flow

  - Begin with any idea at any depth level
  - Nest deeper as details emerge naturally
  - Add supporting points by indenting further
  - Follow your stream of consciousness
- Example: Starting Mid-Level

  - You might start with "quarterly planning meeting"
    - discuss budget allocation
    - review team performance
    - set next quarter goals
  - Later realize this needs a parent context, select all and indent
    - Now you have room above to add "Company Strategy Session"
      - quarterly planning meeting
        - discuss budget allocation
        - review team performance
        - set next quarter goals
## Retroactive Organization Power


- The Magic of Select-and-Indent

  - Write first, organize later
  - Select any group of related items
  - Tab to indent everything as a unit
  - Creates space above for parent concepts
  - Enables bottom-up hierarchy building
- Real-World Workflow

  - Start with scattered thoughts at various levels
  - Group related concepts by selecting and indenting
  - Add overarching themes as parents
  - Refine structure without losing content
  - Transform stream-of-consciousness into organized hierarchy
## Structural Flexibility Examples


- Before Organization (scattered thoughts)

  - meeting with Sarah about project timeline
  - need to order more office supplies
  - review quarterly budget numbers
  - call vendor about delivery delay
  - prepare presentation for board meeting
  - update project documentation
- After Grouping (select related items, indent, add parents)

  - Administrative Tasks
    - meeting with Sarah about project timeline
    - need to order more office supplies
    - call vendor about delivery delay
    - update project documentation
  - Financial Review
    - review quarterly budget numbers
    - prepare presentation for board meeting
## Mental Model Advantages


- Cognitive Benefits

  - Matches natural thinking patterns
  - Reduces decision fatigue about structure
  - Allows focus on content over format
  - Supports iterative refinement of ideas
- Comparison to Traditional Formats

  - Markdown: Must decide header levels upfront
  - Word processors: Fixed document structure
  - Outlines: Require pre-planned hierarchy
  - Loglog: Structure emerges from content
## Advanced Manipulation Techniques


- Multi-Level Restructuring

  - Select entire sections and promote/demote as units
  - Move complex hierarchies around effortlessly
  - Merge separate trains of thought into unified structure
  - Split overgrown sections into separate parents
- Dynamic Reorganization

  - Start with flat list of ideas
  - Gradually cluster related concepts
  - Emerge themes by indenting and adding parents
  - Refine granularity by adjusting depth levels
## The "Growing Tree" Metaphor


- Natural Development

  - Ideas start as seeds (individual items)
  - Related seeds cluster together (select and indent)
  - Clusters grow branches (add parent concepts)
  - Branches develop sub-branches (further nesting)
  - The tree structure emerges organically from the content
- Pruning and Reshaping

  - Move branches to different parts of the tree
  - Split overgrown branches into separate trees
  - Graft ideas from one context into another
  - Maintain the living, flexible nature of the structure
