# Mobile Loglog Editor App Development Plan


## Technical Architecture & Framework Selection


### Platform Strategy


- Cross-platform approach: React Native or Flutter for iOS/Android compatibility
- Alternative: Native development (Swift/Kotlin) for platform-specific optimizations
- Backend: Local-first with optional cloud sync (SQLite + file system)
### Core Technology Stack


- Frontend: React Native (recommended) or Flutter
- State Management: Redux/Zustand or Provider pattern
- Storage: AsyncStorage + File System API for loglog files
- Text Processing: Custom parser based on existing Python loglog logic
- Gestures: Platform gesture recognizers for touch interactions
## Core Data Structure & Logic


### Data Model


- Port existing TreeNode structure from Python to JavaScript/TypeScript
- Implement hierarchical tree data structure with:
  - Node types (regular, todo, root)
  - Indentation levels
  - Folding states
  - Selection states
### Text Processing Engine


- Parser: Convert text to tree structure (port from loglog.py)
- Renderer: Convert tree back to display text with proper indentation
- Real-time parsing: Update tree structure as user types
## User Interface Design


### Main Editor Screen


- Text editor component: Monospace font, line numbers optional
- Indent guides: Visual lines showing nesting levels
- Fold indicators: Triangles (▶/▼) for collapsible sections
- Selection overlay: Highlight selected lines with different color
### Touch Gesture System


- Long-press + drag: Line selection mode (not text selection)
- Swipe left/right: Decrease/increase indentation on selected lines
- Double-tap: Toggle fold/unfold for current line
- Pinch gestures: Zoom in/out for better readability
### Toolbar & Controls


- Indent/outdent buttons: Backup for swipe gestures
- Fold level controls: Buttons for "Fold to Level 1-5", "Unfold All"
- File operations: New, Open, Save, Export
- View options: Font size, theme toggle
## Core Features Implementation


### Phase 1: Basic Editor


- Text input with automatic line creation
- Basic indentation with tab/spaces (4-space default)
- File save/load functionality
- Simple TODO item recognition ([x], [], [?])
### Phase 2: Gesture Controls


- Line selection via long-press + drag
- Swipe left/right for indent/outdent
- Double-tap fold/unfold
- Multi-line selection feedback
### Phase 3: Advanced Features


- Fold all to specific level
- Visual nesting indicators
- Export to markdown, HTML, PDF
- Undo/redo functionality
- Search within document
### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization


- Performance optimization for large documents
- Dark/light theme support
- Customizable gestures
- Cloud sync capabilities
## Touch Interface Design


### Line Selection System


- User Flow:
  - Long-press on line → Enter line selection mode
  - Drag up/down → Extend selection to multiple lines
  - Selected lines highlighted with blue background
  - Swipe right → Increase indentation of selected lines
  - Swipe left → Decrease indentation of selected lines
  - Tap elsewhere → Exit selection mode
### Folding System


- User Flow:
  - Double-tap on line with children → Fold/unfold
  - Folded lines show "..." indicator
  - Toolbar buttons for "Fold Level 1", "Fold Level 2", etc.
  - "Unfold All" button to expand everything
### Gesture Feedback


- Haptic feedback: Light vibration on successful gestures
- Visual feedback: Animations for indent/outdent operations
- Audio feedback: Optional sound effects for folding
## File Management System


### Local Storage


- Documents stored in app's file directory
- Auto-save functionality (save on pause/background)
- Recent files list
- File browser with loglog file preview
### Export Capabilities


- Export to .md (markdown)
- Export to .html (interactive)
- Export to .pdf (via web view rendering)
- Share functionality to other apps
## Development Phases


### MVP (Minimum Viable Product) - 4-6 weeks


- Basic text editor with line-based editing
- Manual indent/outdent buttons
- Save/load files
- Basic TODO recognition
### Beta Version - 8-10 weeks


- Full gesture system implementation
- Folding functionality
- Export to markdown
- Polish UI/UX
### Production Release - 12-14 weeks


- All export formats
- Performance optimizations
- App store submission
- User testing and bug fixes
## Technical Challenges & Solutions


### Challenge: Line-based vs Character-based Selection


- Solution: Custom text input component that tracks lines separately from character positions
### Challenge: Real-time Tree Structure Updates


- Solution: Debounced parsing with incremental updates for performance
### Challenge: Complex Gesture Recognition


- Solution: State machine approach for gesture handling with clear mode transitions
### Challenge: Large Document Performance


- Solution: Virtual scrolling and lazy rendering for documents with 1000+ lines
## Testing Strategy


### Unit Testing


- Parser logic testing with various loglog formats
- Tree structure manipulation functions
- Export functionality validation
### Integration Testing


- Gesture system with UI components
- File operations with storage system
- Cross-platform compatibility testing
### User Acceptance Testing


- Usability testing with target users
- Performance testing on various devices
- Accessibility compliance testing
## Platform-Specific Considerations


### iOS Specific


- Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines
- Integrate with iOS file system and sharing
- Support for iPad with split-screen capabilities
- Leverage iOS haptic feedback system
### Android Specific


- Material Design compliance
- Android file picker integration
- Support for various screen sizes and densities
- Android-specific gesture patterns
