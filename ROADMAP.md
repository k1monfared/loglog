# LogLog GUI Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation Improvements

### 1.1 Clean Up Documentation
- [ ] Remove references to Obsidian, Sublime Text, Notion from README and docs
- [ ] Focus on LogLog's unique features rather than comparisons
- [ ] Update feature descriptions to be self-contained

### 1.2 System Integration
- [ ] Replace custom styling with system theme integration
- [ ] Use system fonts instead of hardcoded font families
- [ ] Implement native scrollbars and UI elements
- [ ] Research open source apps for system theme usage patterns
- [ ] Ensure consistent appearance with other system applications

### 1.3 Theme System Fix
- [ ] Fix dark mode implementation (currently showing light theme)
- [ ] Create proper theme switching mechanism
- [ ] Ensure theme persistence across sessions
- [ ] Test theme switching without restart requirement

## Phase 2: Core Architecture Redesign

### 2.1 Tree-Based Rendering System
- [ ] Analyze HTML export features for parity requirements
- [ ] Implement node-based rendering instead of line-based text
- [ ] Use existing TreeNode class from loglog.py
- [ ] Create GUI components that render individual tree nodes
- [ ] Separate tree structure logic from GUI presentation

### 2.2 HTML Feature Parity
- [ ] Implement folding/collapsing of tree nodes
- [ ] Add focus mode functionality
- [ ] Create smooth animations for node operations
- [ ] Implement tree navigation similar to HTML version
- [ ] Add visual hierarchy indicators

## Phase 3: Advanced Navigation & Interaction

### 3.1 Keyboard Navigation System ✅
- [x] **Arrow Key Navigation:**
  - Up/Down: Move between sibling nodes
  - Left: Move to parent node or collapse current node
  - Right: Move to first child node or expand current node

### 3.2 TODO Status Management ✅
- [x] **Space Bar**: Toggle TODO status ([] ↔ [x] ↔ [-] ↔ [?])
- [x] **Question Mark (?)**: Set TODO to unknown status [?]
- [x] **Minus (-)**: Set TODO to in-progress status [-]
- [x] **Enter**: Enter edit mode for current node text
- [x] **Enter at end of text**: Create new sibling node in edit mode

### 3.3 Selection System ✅
- [x] **Shift+Up/Down**: Extend selection to adjacent siblings
- [x] **Shift+Left**: Select from current node to parent branch
- [x] **Shift+Left (continued)**: Extend selection up the hierarchy
- [x] **Shift+Right**: Select all children of current node
- [x] **Shift+Right (continued)**: Extend selection to grandchildren
- [x] **Shift+Click**: Range selection between focused and clicked node
- [x] **Ctrl+Click**: Toggle individual node selection
- [x] Visual indication of selected nodes
- [x] Bulk operations on selected nodes

## Phase 4: Enhanced User Experience

### 4.1 Search Functionality ✅
- [x] **Ctrl+F**: Simple search across entire document
- [x] **Ctrl+Shift+F**: Scoped search within selected node and children
- [x] Highlight matches and automatic result navigation
- [x] Search result navigation (F3/Shift+F3)
- [x] Case-sensitive and regex search options
- [x] Unfold ancestors to make matches visible

### 4.2 Multi-File Tab System ✅
- [x] **Tab Bar**: VS Code-style tab interface
- [x] **Single-Click**: Open file temporarily (italic tab name)
- [x] **Double-Click**: Pin file permanently (normal tab name)
- [x] **Tab Switching**: Ctrl+Tab, Ctrl+Shift+Tab
- [x] **Tab Closing**: Middle-click or close button
- [x] **Modified Indicators**: Dot (●) for unsaved changes

### 4.3 Enhanced Directory Tree
- [ ] VS Code-style file explorer
- [ ] Expand/collapse folders with proper icons
- [ ] File type icons and color coding
- [ ] Right-click context menus
- [ ] Drag and drop file operations
- [ ] Search within file tree

## Phase 5: Quality & Polish

### 5.1 Undo/Redo System ✅
- [x] Fix Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y functionality
- [x] Implement proper undo stack for tree operations
- [x] Support undo for node operations (edit, TODO status change)
- [x] Visual feedback for undo/redo actions
- [x] 50-action stack limit with proper memory management

### 5.2 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize rendering for large documents
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for huge trees
- [ ] Lazy loading of file tree contents
- [ ] Efficient syntax highlighting updates

### 5.3 Accessibility & Usability
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation support
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] High contrast mode support
- [ ] Tooltips and help system

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Phase 1 & 2) ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ System theme integration
2. ✅ Fix dark mode
3. ✅ Tree-based rendering architecture
4. ✅ Basic keyboard navigation

### Medium Priority (Phase 3) ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Advanced selection system
2. ✅ TODO status shortcuts  
3. ✅ Search functionality
4. ✅ Tab system implementation
5. ✅ Undo/redo system

### Lower Priority (Phase 4 & 5)
1. Enhanced directory tree
2. Performance optimizations
3. Accessibility improvements
4. Advanced features and polish

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Changes
- Separate tree model from view rendering
- Implement proper MVC pattern
- Use observer pattern for tree changes
- Create reusable node components

### Performance Requirements
- Sub-100ms response for navigation actions
- Smooth animations (60fps target)
- Memory efficient for documents with 1000+ nodes
- Fast search implementation

### Compatibility
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing .log files
- Ensure CLI integration continues to work
- Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Navigation feels as responsive as HTML version
- [ ] All HTML export features have GUI equivalents
- [ ] User can efficiently manage large documents (500+ items)
- [ ] Keyboard-only workflow is fully supported
- [ ] Interface matches system appearance standards
