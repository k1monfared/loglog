        [x] Export filtered content maintaining hierarchy
        [x] Multiple hashtag support
        [x] Branch path preservation for filtered results
        [] add option to include children of the node with the hashtag in the exported tree with deduplication
            - e.g. when a branch has hashtag #decision, I might want all the children of that node to be included
            - also some of the children of that node might also have the hashtag #decision or another hashtag in the list that I'm interested in, I don't want those lines to be repeated multiple times. so the process should include them only once without the need to separately deduplicate.
