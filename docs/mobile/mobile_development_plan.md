# React Native Loglog Mobile App Development Plan


## Development Decisions


### Platform Architecture


- React Native with TypeScript for cross-platform compatibility
- Native JavaScript implementation (no Python backend)
- Android-first development, iOS later
- Expo framework for simplified development workflow
### Performance Rationale


- Full native approach for real-time text editing performance
- JavaScript V8/Hermes engine for optimal mobile performance
- No subprocess overhead from Python backend
- Real-time parsing as user types for instant feedback
### Technology Stack


- React Native with TypeScript
- Expo SDK for development tools and deployment
- React Native Reanimated for smooth gesture animations
- React Native Gesture Handler for touch interactions
- AsyncStorage for local file persistence
- React Navigation for app navigation
## Code Architecture


### Core Logic Port Strategy


- Port TreeNode class from loglog.py to TypeScript
- Maintain same tree structure and algorithms
- Keep parsing logic identical to Python version
- Ensure round-trip compatibility with desktop version
### File Structure


- /src/core/ - Core loglog logic (TreeNode, parsing)
- /src/components/ - Reusable UI components
- /src/screens/ - Main app screens
- /src/services/ - File management, export functions
- /src/utils/ - Helper functions and utilities
- /src/types/ - TypeScript type definitions
### State Management


- React Context for global app state
- Local component state for UI interactions
- Document state separate from UI state
- Undo/redo stack for text operations
## Development Phases


### Phase 1: Core Logic Foundation (Week 1-2)


- Set up React Native Expo project
- Port TreeNode class to TypeScript
- Implement tree parsing from text lines
- Add basic unit tests for core logic
- Verify round-trip parsing works correctly
### Phase 2: Basic UI Framework (Week 3-4)


- Create main editor screen layout
- Implement basic text input component
- Add line-by-line text editing
- Create simple file management (new, open, save)
- Basic indentation with tab/untab buttons
### Phase 3: Touch Gesture System (Week 5-6)


- Implement long-press + drag line selection
- Add swipe left/right for indent/outdent
- Create visual feedback for selected lines
- Add haptic feedback for gesture confirmations
- Handle multi-line selection and manipulation
### Phase 4: Folding and Advanced Features (Week 7-8)


- Implement double-tap to fold/unfold
- Add fold-to-level functionality
- Create visual fold indicators (triangles)
- Add keyboard shortcuts for folding
- Implement smooth animations for fold/unfold
### Phase 5: Export and File Management (Week 9-10)


- Port conversion functions (to_md, to_html, to_pdf)
- Implement file browser with loglog file preview
- Add share functionality to other apps
- Create auto-save and backup features
- Add import from other formats
### Phase 6: Polish and Optimization (Week 11-12)


- Performance optimization for large documents
- Add dark/light theme support
- Implement undo/redo functionality
- Add search within document
- Create onboarding and help screens
## Technical Implementation Details


### TreeNode TypeScript Port


- Maintain same interface as Python version
- Use class-based approach for familiarity
- Implement all methods: to_md(), to_html(), etc.
- Add TypeScript types for better development experience
### Text Editor Component


- Custom text input that tracks lines separately
- Line-based selection instead of character-based
- Real-time parsing and tree structure updates
- Debounced parsing for performance on large documents
### Gesture Recognition


- State machine approach for gesture handling
- Long-press detection with configurable threshold
- Drag detection with minimum distance requirements
- Swipe velocity and direction analysis
- Multi-touch prevention for clean gestures
### File Management


- Documents stored in app's document directory
- JSON metadata for file organization
- Automatic backup on app backgrounding
- Recent files list with timestamps
- File export with proper MIME types
## User Interface Design


### Editor Screen Layout


- Full-screen text editor with minimal chrome
- Floating action buttons for common operations
- Collapsible toolbar with advanced features
- Status bar showing document info and cursor position
### Visual Design Principles


- Monospace font for consistent indentation display
- Indent guides showing nesting levels
- Subtle fold indicators (▶/▼ triangles)
- Clean, distraction-free interface
- High contrast for accessibility
### Touch Interaction Patterns


- Long-press + drag for line selection (not text selection)
- Swipe gestures on selected lines for indent/outdent
- Double-tap on any line to toggle fold state
- Pinch-to-zoom for better readability
- Pull-down-to-refresh for file reload
## Testing Strategy


### Unit Testing


- Core TreeNode logic with comprehensive test cases
- Parsing functions with various loglog formats
- Round-trip conversion testing
- Edge cases and malformed input handling
### Integration Testing


- Text editor with tree structure updates
- Gesture system with UI feedback
- File operations with actual filesystem
- Export functions with format validation
### Manual Testing


- Real device testing on various Android versions
- Performance testing with large documents (1000+ lines)
- Gesture accuracy and responsiveness testing
- Battery usage and memory leak detection
## Deployment and Distribution


### Development Setup


- Expo development build for testing
- Android Studio for native debugging
- Git workflow with feature branches
- Automated testing on commits
### Release Process


- Expo Application Services (EAS) for builds
- Internal testing with APK distribution
- Google Play Store submission
- Version management and release notes
## Success Metrics


### Performance Targets


- App launch time under 2 seconds
- Text input response time under 50ms
- Fold/unfold animation under 300ms
- File save operation under 1 second
- Memory usage under 100MB for typical documents
### User Experience Goals


- Intuitive gesture discovery without tutorial
- Seamless transition from desktop loglog workflow
- Zero data loss with auto-save functionality
- Export compatibility with existing loglog files
- Smooth performance on mid-range Android devices
