      "        - quite an interesting take on the conflicts between Israel and Palestine. The main theme is how each side struggles with the desire to collaborate to resolve the conflict, but then the strings that pull them back: their society, their own propaganda, their own dogma, etc. The movie tries not to get political, creates a mood of drama and brings life to the otherwise soulless political figures. I learned about the movie when Zoe Keating announces she was working on the soundtrack, and if a good musician works on a movie, it should be a good movie, at least I think so, so I gave it a try and it delivered. A delight to watch.\n",

Umebayashi's theme for the sound track is just penetrating and enriches the whole experience so much. This is the stroy of two neighbors whose spouses cheat with each other, they find out, and in the process of trying to figure out what has happened, that develop feelings for each other. The ethical questions that it brings up, and the way that it challenges the boundaries of the social norms is quite interesting.\n",

In his blog he writes: \"As a young climber it is undeniable that I have been manipulated by the media and popular culture and that some of my own climbs have been subconsciously shaped through what the world perceives to be important in terms of sport. Through time spent in the mountains, away from the crowds, away from the stopwatch and the grades and all the lists of records I've been slowly able to pick apart what is important to me and discard things that are not.\"\n",

      "        - happens in current day Iran and aims to explain the everyday pain that the ordinary people are going through. The story is built slowly and nicely, adding pieces one by one to provide context. The film is rather long and the reality of it is too painful to go through. I got a headache after watching it. One of the nice things about the story is how it brings in each person's point of view and tries to explain why everyone does what they do. It's probably the only movie I've seen that portraits how women are treated by people around them, and not just the systemic problems that exist. Although the main theme of the movie is about poverty and how it causes bad decisions that in turn result in more poverty, and one person's tough realistic approach to counter it, it doesn't shy away from bringing up front the everyday cultural and otherwise problems such as extreme gender inequality, family issues, body-shaming, ignorance and dogma against mental health problems, superstitions, toxic social norms and interactions, as well as systemic problems which all contribute to the overall dire situation. The movie is extremely honest, which makes is very painful to watch, but is highly recommended.\n",

I had to watch the movie for a second time so that at least I could say I have watched it. It's about drug addiction and the problems that it causes.
