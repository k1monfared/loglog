# LogLog Project Documentation Index

## Project Overview

**LogLog** is a hierarchical note-taking format and ecosystem that embraces the philosophy of "everything is a list" with minimal structural overhead. The project includes both a Python library for text processing and a full-featured React Native mobile application.

## Core Philosophy

### Zero Structural Overhead
- **Everything is a list** - no decisions about headers, sections, or paragraphs
- **Mind-first structure** - start writing wherever your thoughts naturally flow  
- **Retroactive organization** - structure emerges from content through simple indentation
- **Select-and-indent** - easily restructure by selecting content and adjusting indentation levels

### Flexible Depth Management
- Start at any depth level without pre-planning hierarchy
- Go deeper by nesting more content inside existing items
- Create parent contexts by selecting groups and indenting to make space above
- Bottom-up hierarchy building that matches natural thinking patterns

## Project Components

### 1. Python Library (Core)
**Location**: `/loglog.py`, `/tree.ipynb`

**Features**:
- TreeNode data structure for hierarchical content representation
- Text parsing and conversion between formats (loglog â†” markdown â†” HTML)
- Interactive HTML generation with folding, themes, and keyboard navigation
- Command-line tools for file processing and format conversion

**Key Capabilities**:
- Shallowest leaf depth algorithm for intelligent markdown conversion
- Self-contained HTML exports with embedded CSS/JavaScript
- TODO item support with completion tracking
- Cross-platform compatibility and future-proof plain text format

### 2. Mobile Application (React Native)
**Location**: `/loglog-mobile/`

**Features**:
- Advanced gesture-based editing with haptic feedback
- Real-time hierarchical parsing and visual feedback
- Persistent file storage with metadata management
- Multi-format export with native sharing integration
- Performance optimizations for large documents

**Status**: Production ready âœ… (5 development phases completed)

### 3. Linux Native Tools (Planned)
**Location**: `/loglog-linux/` (future)

**Philosophy**: Unix-style tools that respect user's text editor choice while providing specialized loglog format capabilities.

**Components**:
- **Enhanced CLI Tools**: Extended command-line interface for format conversion, validation, and batch processing
- **GUI Viewer/Light Editor**: GTK4-based application for viewing, navigation, and structural editing
- **Desktop Integration**: File associations, MIME types, and native Linux integration

**Approach**:
- **Phase 1**: Enhanced CLI with PDF conversion, batch processing, file watching
- **Phase 2**: GUI viewer with interactive folding, outline navigation, auto-reload  
- **Phase 3**: Light editing capabilities (line operations, indentation, TODO toggles)
- **Phase 4**: Find/replace functionality and performance optimization
