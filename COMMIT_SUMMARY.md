## Key Planning Decisions

### Technology Stack: GTK4 + Python
**Rationale**: Direct reuse of existing loglog.py code, native Linux integration, superior performance vs Electron

### Philosophy: Unix-Style Tools Approach
**Core Principle**: Users edit with their preferred text editor; LogLog tools handle viewing, conversion, and light structural editing

### Implementation Strategy: 4-Phase Development (8 weeks)
1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Enhanced CLI tools with PDF conversion, batch processing
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4)**: GUI viewer with interactive folding, auto-reload
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6)**: Light editing capabilities (structural operations)
4. **Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8)**: Find/replace functionality and performance optimization

## Strategic Context

### Project Ecosystem Evolution
1. **Python Library** - âœ… Complete (Core functionality)
2. **Mobile Application** - âœ… Production Ready (5 phases, comprehensive features)
3. **Linux Native Tools** - ðŸ“‹ Planned (Unix-philosophy approach)

### Target User Workflows

#### Command-Line Integration
```bash
# Edit with favorite editor
vim meeting_notes.log

# Quick conversions  
loglog meeting_notes.log --to_html --theme dark
loglog meeting_notes.log --to_pdf --style professional

# Live preview
loglog meeting_notes.log --watch --to_html
```

#### GUI Viewer/Light Editor
- Interactive document viewing with HTML-like folding
- Structural editing: indentation, TODO toggles, line operations
- Find/replace with preview mode
- Auto-reload when file changes externally
- Native Linux desktop integration

### Performance Targets
- **CLI**: Convert 1000-line document in < 1 second
- **GUI**: Smooth interaction with 5000+ line documents  
- **Memory**: < 50MB for typical documents
- **Startup**: < 2 seconds for GUI application

## Development Readiness

### Technical Foundation
- **Code Reuse**: Direct integration with existing loglog.py library
- **Architecture**: Well-defined component separation (CLI tools, GUI viewer, desktop integration)
- **Distribution**: Clear packaging strategy (PyPI primary, system packages, Flatpak)

### User Experience Design
- **Learning Curve**: 10-minute productivity target for new users
- **Integration**: Seamless workflow with existing text editors
- **Performance**: Handles large documents beyond mobile constraints

### Quality Assurance
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive testing across Linux distributions
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Specific measurable targets
- **User Validation**: Clear success metrics for adoption and functionality

## Impact Assessment

### Platform Expansion
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Covers mobile, desktop, and command-line use cases
- **User Base Growth**: Appeals to Linux developers and technical users
- **Format Standardization**: Strengthens loglog format adoption across platforms

### Technical Innovation  
- **Unix Philosophy**: Respects existing workflows while adding specialized capabilities
- **Performance Scaling**: Handles larger documents than mobile constraints allow
- **Desktop Integration**: Native Linux features and file associations

### Strategic Value
- **Developer Adoption**: Linux tools appeal to technical early adopters
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamless integration with development and research workflows
- **Market Differentiation**: Unique combination of simplicity and power

This planning milestone establishes a clear, implementable roadmap for bringing LogLog's hierarchical note-taking philosophy to Linux desktop environments while maintaining the project's core values of minimal structural overhead and user-centric design.

## Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 1 implementation (Enhanced CLI tools)
2. Validate approach with community feedback
3. Iterate based on user testing and performance requirements
