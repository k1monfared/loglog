# loglog

A simple way of taking notes with absolute minimum structure. Everything is a list, even the list items are lists.

## What is LogLog?

LogLog is a hierarchical note-taking format that eliminates structural decision-making from the writing process. You can start writing at any depth level and reorganize later through simple indentation.

**Example:**
```
- Project Ideas
    - Mobile App
        - User authentication
        - Data synchronization  
        [] Implement offline mode
        [x] Design wireframes
    - Desktop Tool
        - CLI interface
        - GUI application
```

## Core Philosophy

**Zero Structural Overhead**: No need to decide between headers, sections, lists, or paragraphs. Everything is a list item that can be nested indefinitely.

**Mind-First Structure**: Start writing wherever your thoughts flow, then organize retroactively by selecting and indenting.

## Key Benefits

- **Reduces cognitive load** - focus on content, not formatting
- **Highly flexible** - restructure by simple indentation  
- **Cross-platform** - plain text files work everywhere
- **Foldable in most editors** - collapse/expand sections
- **Algorithmically parseable** - enables powerful tooling

## Quick Start

1. **Create a `.log` file** and start writing with dashes:
   ```
   - Your first thought
       - Supporting detail
       - Another detail
   - Second main thought
   ```

2. **Use TODO syntax** for tasks:
   ```
   [] Pending task
   [x] Completed task
   [?] Unknown status
   ```

3. **Convert to other formats**:
   ```python
   from loglog import build_tree_from_file, to_html_file, to_md_file
   
   # Convert to interactive HTML
   to_html_file('notes.log')
   
   # Convert to Markdown
   to_md_file('notes.log')
   ```

## Features

### Desktop Python Library âœ…
- **Tree parsing and manipulation**
- **Format conversion**: Markdown â†” LogLog, HTML (interactive), LaTeX, PDF
- **TODO management** with status tracking
- **Hashtag filtering** - extract sections by tags (`#decision`, `#important`)
- **Branch preservation** - maintain structure when filtering

### Mobile Application âœ…
- **React Native app** with gesture-based editing
- **Real-time parsing** and visual feedback  
- **File management** with persistent storage
- **Multi-format export** and native sharing
- **Advanced touch controls** (swipe to indent, double-tap to fold)

**Status**: Production ready, pending device testing

### Planned Features ðŸ“‹
- **Linux desktop GUI** with file browser and editor
- **Command-line interface** for batch operations
- **Search functionality** across document collections
- **Knowledge graph generation** from related topics
