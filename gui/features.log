        - up/down: goes to the previous/next item that is visible (does not change fold state)
        - left: 
            - if it is a leaf node, goes to the parent node
            - if it is a foldable node
                - if it is not folded, folds it
                - if it is folded, gows to the parent node 
            - if it is a root node, does nothing
            - hence repeatedly pressing left on a folded node goes to the parent node and all the way up to the root node
        - right:
            - if it is a leaf node, does nothing
            - if it is a foldable node
                - if it is not folded, goes to the first child node if any
                - if it is folded, unfolds it
            - hence repeatedly pressing right on a node goes to the first child node and all the way down to first the leaf node
        - enter: enters text edit mode 
        - esc: exits text edit mode
        - pgup/pgdown: scrolls up/down by one page
        - ctrl+1/2/3/... folds/unfolds all the nodes at level 1/2/3/...
        - ctrl+alt+1/2/3/... fpolds/unfolds all the other (except the current branch) nodes at level 1/2/3/...
        - ctrl+shift+1/2/3/... folds/unfolds only the current branch at level 1/2/3/...
        - space: cycles through to do item states: not done (empty) -> in progress (-) -> done (checked) -> not done (empty)
        - ?: on a to do item puts it in unkown state (?)
        - tab, alt+right: indents the item(s) (makes it a child of the previous sibling item)
        - shift+tab, alt+left: outdents the item(s) (makes it a sibling of the parent
        - shift+up/down: selects multiple items
        - ctrl+up/down: keeps the selected item and moves to the previous/next item where space selects the item as well as all previously selected items 
        - alt+up/down: moves the selected item(s) up/down keeping the relative structure
            - if the movement crosses a foldable node, the node does not unfold 
            - if the movement crosses a level, all items are kept at their current level, to make it go up/down a level, use alt+left/right
                - this could potentially cause a node having multiple empty layers and then some children, e.g.
                    - example
                        - item 1
                            - item 1.1
                                - 
                                    - 
                                        - item 2.1.1.1.2
                        - item 2
                            item 2.1
                                - item 2.1.1
                                    - item 2.1.1.1
                                        - item 2.1.1.1.1
                    - where  item 2.1.1.1.2 was moved from under item  item 2.1.1.1.1 up to under item 1.1.
                    - this is not a problem and is allowed, but if you want to bring it back to level 3, use alt+left to outdent it twice
        - ctrl+c: copies the selected item(s) to clipboard
        - ctrl+x: cuts the selected item(s) to clipboard
        - ctrl+v: pastes the item(s) from clipboard as the next sibling of the current item, keeping the original relative structure
        - ctrl+z: undo
        - ctrl+y: redo
        - ctrl+0: toggles between fold all and unfold all
        - ctrl+a: selects all items

        - ctrl+g: goes to the next search result
        - ctrl+shift+g: goes to the previous search result
        - home: goes to the first item
        - end: goes to the last item
    - mouse
        - click: selects an item 
        - double click: enters text edit mode
        - click outside an item in edit mode: exits text edit mode
        - click on the fold/unfold icon (triangle): folds/unfolds the item
        - click on the to do icon (checkbox): cycles through to do item states: not done -> in progress -> done -> not done
        - ctrl+click: keeps the selected item and selects the clicked item as well as all previously selected items
        - shift+click: selects all items between the selected item and the clicked item
            - always the very first item and the very last item and everything in between are selected and nothing else 
        - drag and drop: 
            - on selected item(s): moves the selected item(s) to the drop target as the next sibling, keeping the original relative structure

        - scroll wheel: scrolls up/down
        - right click: shows context menu
            - add item before: adds a new item before the current item
            - add item after: adds a new item after the current item
            - add child item: adds a new item as the last child of the current item
            - delete item(s): deletes the selected item(s)
            - cut item(s): cuts the selected item(s) to clipboard
            - copy item(s): copies the selected item(s) to clipboard
            - paste item(s): pastes the item(s) from clipboard as the next sibling of the current item, keeping the original relative structure
            - indent item(s): indents the selected item(s) (makes it a child of the previous sibling item)
            - outdent item(s): outdents the selected item(s) (makes it a sibling of the parent
            - fold/unfold item: folds/unfolds the current item
