- **Performance optimizations** for large documents (1000+ lines)
- **Comprehensive undo/redo system** with visual feedback
- **Professional UI** with haptic feedback and visual indicators

- **PanResponder** for complex gesture recognition
- **Animated API** for smooth visual feedback

### Key Design Patterns
- **Component composition** for modular UI architecture
- **Custom hooks** for state management and performance optimization
- **Service layer pattern** for file management and export functionality
- **Observer pattern** for real-time document updates
- **Cache-aside pattern** for performance optimization

### State Management Strategy
- **React hooks** (`useState`, `useCallback`, `useRef`) for local component state
- **Context pattern** for cross-component data sharing (prepared for future use)
- **Custom hooks** for complex state logic (undo/redo, performance optimization)
- **Debouncing/throttling** for performance-critical operations

### Performance Optimizations
- **Memoization** of expensive parsing operations
- **Virtual scrolling** preparation for large documents
- **LRU cache** for text processing operations
- **Throttled updates** for real-time editing
- **Memory management** with automatic cleanup
