Description: Hierarchical note-taking format and CLI tool
 LogLog is a hierarchical note-taking format that eliminates structural
 decision-making from the writing process. Everything is a list, even
 list items are lists, allowing you to start writing at any depth level
 and reorganize later through simple indentation.
 .
 Features include:
  * Zero structural overhead - focus on content, not formatting
  * Cross-platform plain text files
  * Algorithmically parseable for powerful tooling
  * TODO management with status tracking
  * Format conversion (HTML, Markdown, LaTeX, PDF)
  * Hashtag filtering and content extraction
  * Batch processing capabilities
  * Interactive HTML export with keyboard navigation
 .
 The package includes a comprehensive command-line interface for
 file conversion, content filtering, TODO management, and batch operations.
