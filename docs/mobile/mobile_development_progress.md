    - Added serialization methods (toData/fromData) for storage
  - [x] Created parser functions for loglog text format
    - parseLine() function extracts indentation, content, and type
    - buildTreeFromText() creates tree structure from text lines
    - buildTreeFromString() handles full document parsing
    - treeToText() converts tree back to loglog format
    - getNode() function for tree navigation by address
- Basic UI Components

  - [x] Created LoglogEditor component with real-time parsing
    - TextInput with monospace font for consistent indentation
    - Real-time tree structure updates as user types
    - ScrollView integration for large documents
    - Status bar showing document state (modified/saved)
  - [x] Updated App.tsx with demo content showcasing loglog format
    - Sample hierarchical content with nested items
    - Example todo items with different status types
    - Integration with LoglogEditor component
- Testing and Validation

  - [ ] Unit tests for TreeNode class methods
  - [ ] Parser function tests with various loglog formats
  - [ ] Round-trip conversion testing (text → tree → text)
  - [ ] Edge case handling (empty lines, malformed input)
- Current Status

  - Basic text editor is functional with real-time parsing
  - Tree structure correctly builds from loglog text
  - Ready to start implementing gesture system in Phase 2
  - Need to add testing before moving to next phase

    - Visual hierarchy with indentation-based padding
## Phase 3: Touch Gesture System (Week 5-6) - COMPLETED


- Advanced Swipe Gestures

  - [x] Implemented PanResponder for swipe detection
    - Horizontal swipe threshold of 50px for reliable recognition
    - Visual feedback during drag with animated translateX
    - Direction detection for left/right swipe actions
    - Smooth spring animation back to neutral position
  - [x] Swipe-based indentation controls
    - Swipe right to indent selected lines (add 4 spaces)
    - Swipe left to outdent selected lines (remove up to 4 spaces)
    - Works on single or multiple selected lines
    - Real-time visual indicator showing swipe direction
- Double-Tap Folding System

  - [x] Double-tap gesture recognition
    - 300ms delay detection between taps
    - Accurate line targeting for fold/unfold operations
    - Visual fold indicators with ▶/▼ triangles
    - Smooth folding with immediate visual feedback
  - [x] Hierarchical folding logic
    - Fold lines that have children at deeper levels
    - Hide child lines when parent is folded
    - Maintain correct indentation when unfolding
    - Filter visible lines based on folding state
- Enhanced User Interface
